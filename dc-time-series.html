<!--The external data source that we've been using over the last couple of Units also contains dates of when purchases were made. A line graph nicely represents changes over time. So let's try one now. -->

    <!--So the first thing we do is we create our div and let's give it a heading called Total Spend Per Month. We have our queue() function in place. We have our script imports in place. So let's give our div an id which is "spend-per-month". -->
        <h3>Total Spend Per Month</h3>
        <div id="chart-here"></div>
    </div>

    <script>
    
    //  We have our queue() function in place. We have our script imports in place.
    queue()
        .defer(d3.json, "data/transactions.json")
        .await(makeGraphs);
        
    //  Okay, our make graph is emptied out all that's there is our ndx cross filter that uses a transaction data postions of parameter. Now we want to make sure that the data.    

    function makeGraphs(error, transactionsData) {
        
        
        var ndx = crossfilter(transactionsData);
    //  In particular the date format is formatted in a way that can be represented by cross filter DC and d3, and you can ensure this by using a format function that that comes with d3. So you can specify the date format, whether it's US European and so on. Wwhat we do then is, we iterate through each of the date entries and format the data entry as per the specification (var parseDate = d3.time.format("%d/%m/%Y").parse;).
        var parseDate = d3.time.format("%d/%m/%Y").parse;
        
    //  Here you might recognize the function D as a parameter from an earlier unit, when we first started working d3. D represents a datum in our dataset. So what we're doing here is we're parsing the date entries and formatting them.
        transactionsData.forEach(function(d){
            d.date = parseDate(d.date);
        });
    //  Then we create our dimension and we're working with "date" and "spend" across those dates. 
        var date_dim = ndx.dimension(dc.pluck('date'));
        var total_spend_per_date = date_dim.group().reduceSum(dc.pluck('spend'));
        
    //  We're going to examine and extract the minimum date and the maximum dates that are available on our dataset. So we get the oldest date by using bottom data and the newest date by using "date_dim.top", so these will provide us with our domain.
        var minDate = date_dim.bottom(1)[0].date;
        var maxDate = date_dim.top(1)[0].date;
        
    //  And once these variables are in place the rest should look quite similar to the steps required to create pie charts and bar charts, but instead of a radius, in this case we set a width and a height we also set some margins, for breathing space around the graph itself, and remember these top right and bottom they're relative to the parent viewport and the div itself, not the entire browser screen. 

        dc.lineChart("#chart-here")
            .width(1000)
            .height(300)
            .margins({top: 10, right: 50, bottom: 30, left: 50})
            
    //  Okay we access our dimension which is date_dim, and we group the group by total spend for a month.
            .dimension(date_dim)
            .group(total_spend_per_date)
            
    //  Set transition duration as well.Then set again. Let's set this for 500 milliseconds.
    
    //  Just a reminder, this is a chaining of functions, all from line charts. You can see the dot in front of them, so the common mistakes is to put a semicolon after say width or height or dimension. These are all chained together until you reach the end of the chain, and only then should you put a semicolon to indicate the end of the functional chain.
            .transitionDuration(500)
    
    //  Our timescale uses our min data and our max data, and we set an x-axis label from per month and we use the y-axis, we set the number of ticks. I need 4.

            .x(d3.time.scale().domain([minDate,maxDate]))
            .xAxisLabel("Month")
            .yAxis().ticks(4);
            
    //  Then we call render all. 
        dc.renderAll();
    }
    
    //  Let's take a look at it, clicking open, we can see our line graph, and there are our month intervals, and you can also segment as well using what's called a "brush", you can see it here, that's available by default automatically.
